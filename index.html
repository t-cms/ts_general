        <h1>How Conservative Isolation in Maryland Fueled January 6th</h1>

        <p>
            Four years after the January 6th insurrection, President Donald Trump pledged to pardon more than a thousand
            participants, among them, dozens from Maryland. Of the 46 Marylanders charged in connection with the attack,
            32 came from counties that voted overwhelmingly for Joe Biden. This trend of a higher number of January 6th
            participants coming from blue counties is understandable, as Maryland's blue counties tend to have larger
            populations. With more people living in these areas, it's statistically likely that a greater number of
            individuals from these regions would be involved in the insurrection, regardless of their political
            affiliation.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is not difficult to come from a blue county in Maryland, but I think it might have made right-wingers
            feel angry. Being surrounded by not just Democrats for many cases, but liberal Democrats, and places like
            Montgomery, Howard, and Baltimore counties," Matthew Crenson, a professor emeritus of political science at
            Johns Hopkins University, explained.
        </p>
        <p>
            "He added, 'So they may have, because they were exposed to unfriendly, hostile, political opinions; been
            induced to become hostile themselves, and that may have driven them to travel to Washington on January 6th.'"
        </p>
        <p>
            This sense of political isolation is not unique to Maryland but is part of a larger, national trend where
            individuals in politically homogeneous environments can become more entrenched in their beliefs, sometimes
            to the point of radicalization.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to the Becker Friedman Institute report, this isolation creates an aggressive mentality, where
            individuals who feel marginalized by the dominant political culture around them may seek out violent ways to
            express their frustrations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, this sense of alienation is not confined to rural or conservative areas; in fact, it can
            thrive even in more liberal environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yeah. I think, unfortunately, that has been the case, right? Because of, especially because of the
            internet, like, it's not just that we see, unfortunately, Neo-Nazis in like Southern, deep red states, like,
            you know, there was, like, a neo-Nazi group that wanted to make a white ethno-state in, like, Maine, right?
            Like they exist in very blue places too," Jon Lewis, a Research Fellow at the Program on Extremism at George
            Washington University, said.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Maryland, particularly in the state's urban and suburban areas, where liberal policies often dominate,
            some right-leaning individuals might have felt alienated or even demonized by the progressive views of their
            neighbors. This sense of alienation could have fueled a desire to make a political statement, culminating in
            the violent actions on January 6th.
        </p>

        <p>
            Take Frederick County, for example, traditionally a swing county that has seen a growing divide, with more
            residents leaning towards right-wing ideologies. The county's unique political landscape reflects Maryland's
            broader national tensions.
        </p>

                class="frederick_chart" />
        </div>
        <p>
            Though Frederick County supported Biden in 2020, the county exhibited a notable shift in local politics,
            with increasing numbers of right-leaning voters. This shift, paired with its proximity to both liberal
            cities like Baltimore and Washington, D.C. and more conservative rural areas, created an environment ripe
            for political friction.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Matthew Crenson explained, the political landscape in Maryland has shifted significantly over time. "The
            Democrats outnumbered Republicans in the state by two to one. So, the Republicans were confined to the
            Eastern Shore and Western Maryland, and that was changing too, because some previously Republican areas were
            becoming more Democratic, like Frederick, as Washington commuters moved west."
        </p>
        <p>
            In April, the Frederick Gun and Knife Show's gathering for pro-gun Marylanders from various counties served
            as another reflection of the state's political divide. Under the glow of fluorescent lights, rows of tables
            displayed weapons, military memorabilia, and graphic t-shirts emblazoned with slogans like "Ammosexual" and
            "Trump: Better Coverage Than 5G Can You Hear Us Now?"
        </p>
        <p>
            An attendee, Bruce Byrd, a senior resident of Prince George's County, expressed several concerns about the
            state of politics in Maryland. "We're running the old timers out, because we're going to turn it into a
            bedroom community," Byrd said of areas like Frederick County, where many residents commute to work in
            Washington, D.C.
        </p>
        <p>
            Further exacerbating this sense of alienation is the rise of radicalization via social media. A 2023 George
            Washington study described the current generation of extremism as being more intense and driven by encrypted
            social media platforms where individuals prioritize personal privacy and group secrecy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dr. Kyle Larson, a Senior Research Associate at Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the  University of Chicago explained that political violence is often shaped by an individual's
            mindset, online activity, and personal observations.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Any given instance of political violence is going to be informed in large part or at least in part by
            what's going on in the head of the individual," Larson said. "The head of the individual may be informed by
            things like what websites they're spending time reading, but it may also be informed by their personal
            observation of the world around them."
        </p>

        <p>
            "You can't fully discount local factors, especially when you're looking at something as individualized as an
            act of political violence," he added.

                Hey, this is where I'm at so far (finished this by 1 am). I added another visual representing Frederick
                in the past four presidential elections. I added the J6 people count to the first map. I plan to add a
                few more graphs, organize, and edit. I will be ready for a final review by Monday's class. I look
                forward to what you think!!
