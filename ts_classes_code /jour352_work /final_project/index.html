                    <p>
                        Candace Fails screamed for someone in the Texas hospital to help her pregnant daughter. “Do
                        something,” she pleaded, on the morning of Oct. 29, 2023. Nevaeh Crain was crying in pain, too
                        weak to walk, blood staining her thighs. Feverish and vomiting the day of her baby shower, the
                        18-year-old had gone to two different emergency rooms within 12 hours, returning home each time
                        worse than before. The first hospital diagnosed her with strep throat without investigating her
                        sharp abdominal cramps. At the second, she screened positive for sepsis, a life-threatening and
                        fast-moving reaction to an infection, medical records show. But doctors said her six-month fetus
                        had a heartbeat and that Crain was fine to leave. Now on Crain’s third hospital visit, an
                        obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to “confirm fetal demise,” a nurse wrote, before moving
                        her to intensive care. By then, more than two hours after her arrival, Crain’s blood pressure
                        had plummeted and a nurse had noted that her lips were “blue and dusky.” Her organs began
                        failing. <strong>Hours later, she was dead.</strong>

                        Fails and Crain believed abortion was morally wrong. The teen could only support it in the
                        context of rape or life-threatening illness, she used to tell her mother. They didn’t care
                        whether the government banned it, just how their Christian faith guided their own actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When they discovered Crain was pregnant with a girl, the two talked endlessly about the little
                        dresses they could buy, what kind of mother she would be. Crain landed on the name Lillian.
                        Fails could not wait to meet her. But when her daughter got sick, Fails expected that doctors
                        had an obligation to do everything in their power to stave off a potentially deadly emergency,
                        even if that meant losing Lillian. In her view, they were more concerned with checking the fetal
                        heartbeat than attending to Crain.

                        <li>
                            In June 2022, the U.S Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right
                            to abortion.

                        <li>
                            State-Level Bans and Restrictions: Many states, particularly in the South and Midwest,
                            enacted near-total abortion bans or stricter limits.affected due to limited resources to
                            seek care out of state.

                            Increase in Travel for Care: People in restrictive states began traveling to states where
                            abortion remained legal, often experiencing significant logistical and financial barriers.

                        <li>
                            Clinic Closures: Numerous clinics in restrictive states closed, reducing access to
                            reproductive healthcare broadly.

                        <li>
                            Legal Uncertainty: Confusion around exceptions (e.g., for rape, incest, or maternal health)
                            led to delays or denials of necessary care.

                        Crain had just graduated from high school in her hometown of Vidor, Texas, in May of 2023 when
                        she learned that she was pregnant. She and her boyfriend of two years, Randall Broussard, were
                        always hip to hip, wrestling over vapes or snuggling on the couch watching vampire movies. Crain
                        was drawn to how gentle he was. He admired how easily she built friendships and how quickly she
                        could make people laugh. Though they were young, they’d already imagined starting a family.
                        Broussard, who has eight siblings, wanted many kids; Crain wanted a daughter and the kind of
                        relationship she had with her mom. Earlier that year, Broussard had given Crain a small diamond
                        ring — “a promise,” he told her, “that I will always love you.” On the morning of their baby
                        shower, Oct. 28, 2023, Crain woke with a headache. Her mom decorated the house with pink
                        balloons and Crain laid out Halloween-themed platters. Soon, nausea set in. Crain started
                        vomiting and was running a fever. When guests arrived, Broussard opened gifts — onesies and
                        diapers and bows — while Crain kept closing her eyes. Around 3 p.m., her family told her she
                        needed to go to the hospital. Broussard drove Crain to Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas.
                        They sat in the waiting room for four hours. When Crain started vomiting, staff brought her a
                        plastic pan. When she wasn’t retching, she lay her head in her boyfriend’s lap. A nurse
                        practitioner ordered a test for strep throat, which came back positive, medical records show.
                        <strong
                            >But in a pregnant patient, abdominal pain and vomiting should not be quickly attributed to

                        Baptist Hospitals discharged her with a prescription for antibiotics. She was home at 9 p.m. and
                        quickly dozed off, but within hours, she woke her mother up.

                        Fails drove Broussard and Crain to another hospital in town, Christus Southeast Texas St.
                        Elizabeth. Around 4:20 a.m., OB-GYN William Hawkins saw that Crain had a temperature of 102.8
                        and an abnormally high pulse, according to records; a nurse noted that Crain rated her abdominal
                        pain as a seven out of 10.

                        <strong>Her vital signs pointed to possible sepsis,</strong> records show. It’s standard medical
                        practice to immediately treat patients who show signs of sepsis, which can overtake and kill a
                        person quickly, medical experts told ProPublica. These patients should be watched until their
                        vitals improve. Through tests and scans, the goal is to find the source of the infection. If the
                        infection was in Crain’s uterus, the fetus would likely need to be removed with a surgery. In a
                        room at the obstetric emergency department, a nurse wrapped a sensor belt around Crain’s belly
                        to check the fetal heart rate. “Baby’s fine,” Broussard told Fails, who was sitting in the
                        hallway.

                        <strong
                            >After two hours of IV fluids, one dose of antibiotics, and some Tylenol, Crain’s fever
                            didn’t go down, her pulse remained high, and the fetal heart rate was abnormally fast,
                            medical records show. Hawkins noted that Crain had strep and a urinary tract infection,
                            wrote up a prescription and discharged her.</strong
                        >

                        Hawkins had missed infections before. Eight years earlier, the Texas Medical Board found that he
                        had failed to diagnose appendicitis in one patient and syphilis in another. In the latter case,
                        the board noted that his error “may have contributed to the fetal demise of one of her twins.”
                        The board issued an order to have Hawkins’ medical practice monitored; the order was lifted two
                        years later. (Hawkins did not respond to several attempts to reach him.)

                        <strong
                            >All of the doctors who reviewed Crain’s vital signs for ProPublica said she should have
                            been admitted. “She should have never left, never left,”</strong
                        >
                        said Elise Boos, an OB-GYN in Tennessee. Kass, the New York emergency physician, put it in
                        starker terms: When they discharged her, they were “pushing her down the path of no return.”
                        “It’s bullshit,” Fails said as Broussard rolled Crain out in a wheelchair; she was unable to
                        walk on her own. Fails had expected the hospital to keep her overnight.

                        Back home, around 7 a.m., Fails tried to get her daughter comfortable as she cried and moaned.
                        She told Fails she needed to pee, and her mother helped her into the bathroom. “Mom, come here,”
                        she said from the toilet. Blood stained her underwear. The blood confirmed Fails’ instinct: This
                        was a miscarriage. At 9 a.m, a full day after the nausea began, they were back at Christus St.
                        Elizabeth.

                        Staff started her on IV antibiotics and performed a bedside ultrasound. Around 9:30 a.m., the OB

                        Standard protocol when a critically ill patient experiences a miscarriage is to stabilize her
                        and, in most cases, hurry to the operating room for delivery, medical experts said. his is
                        especially urgent with a spreading infection. But at Christus St. Elizabeth, the OB-GYN just
                        continued antibiotic care. A half-hour later, as nurses placed a catheter, Fails noticed her
                        daughter’s thighs were covered in blood. At 10 a.m., Melissa McIntosh, a labor and delivery
                        nurse, spoke to Totorica about Crain’s condition. The teen was now having contractions. “Dr.
                        Totorica states to not move patient,” she wrote after talking with him. “Dr. Totorica states
                        there is a slight chance patient may need to go to ICU and he wants the bedside ultrasound to be
                        done stat for sure before admitting to room.” Though he had already performed an ultrasound, he
                        was asking for a second. The first hadn’t preserved an image of Crain’s womb in the medical
                        record. “Bedside ultrasounds aren’t always set up to save images permanently,” said Abbott, the
                        Boston OB-GYN.

                        At 10:40 a.m, Crain’s blood pressure was dropping. Minutes later, Totorica was paging for an
                        emergency team over the loudspeakers. Around 11 a.m., two hours after Crain had arrived at the
                        hospital, a second ultrasound was performed. A nurse noted: “Bedside ultrasound at this time to
                        confirm fetal demise per Dr. Totorica’s orders.” When doctors wheeled Crain into the ICU at
                        11:20 a.m., Fails stayed by her side, rubbing her head, as her daughter dipped in and out of
                        consciousness. Crain couldn’t sign consent forms for her care because of “extreme pain,”
                        according to the records, so Fails signed a release for “unplanned dilation and curettage” or
                        “unplanned cesarean section.” But the doctors quickly decided it was now too risky to operate,
                        according to records. They suspected that she had developed a dangerous complication of sepsis
                        known as disseminated intravascular coagulation; she was bleeding internally. Frantic and
                        crying, Fails locked eyes with her daughter.
                        <strong>“You’re strong, Nevaeh,” she said. “God made us strong.”</strong> Crain sat up in the
                        cot. Old, black blood gushed from her nostrils and mouth.

                        “The Law Is on Our Side” Crain is one of at least two pregnant Texas women who died after
                        doctors delayed treating miscarriages, ProPublica found. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has
                        successfully made his state the only one in the country that isn’t required to follow the Biden
                        administration’s efforts to ensure that emergency departments don’t turn away patients like
                        Crain. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, the
                        administration issued guidance on how states with bans should follow the Emergency Medical
                        Treatment and Labor Act. The federal law requires hospitals that receive funding through
                        Medicare — which is virtually all of them — to stabilize or transfer anyone who arrives in their
                        emergency rooms. That goes for pregnant patients, the guidance argues, even if that means
                        violating state law and providing an abortion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paxton responded by filing a lawsuit in 2022, saying the federal guidance “forces hospitals and
                        doctors to commit crimes,” and was an “attempt to use federal law to transform every emergency
                        room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic.” Part of the battle has centered on who is
                        eligible for abortion. The federal EMTALA guidelines apply when the health of the pregnant
                        patient is in “serious jeopardy.” That’s a wider range of circumstances than the Texas abortion
                        restriction, which only makes exceptions for a “risk of death” or “a serious risk of substantial
                        impairment of a major bodily function.” The lawsuit worked its way through three layers of
                        federal courts, and each time it was met by judges nominated by former President Donald Trump,
                        whose court appointments were pivotal to overturning Roe v. Wade. After U.S. District Judge
                        James Wesley Hendrix, a Trump appointee, quickly sided with Texas, Paxton celebrated the triumph
                        over “left-wing bureaucrats in Washington.” “The decision last night proves what we knew all
                        along,” Paxton added. “The law is on our side.”

                    <p>
                        This year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the order in a ruling authored
                        by Kurt D. Engelhardt, another judge nominated by Trump. The Biden administration appealed to
                        the U.S. Supreme Court, urging the justices to make it clear that some emergency abortions are
                        allowed. Even amid news of preventable deaths related to abortion bans, the Supreme Court
                        declined to do so last month. Paxton called this “a major victory” for the state’s abortion ban.
                        He has also made clear that he will bring charges against physicians for performing abortions if
                        he decides that the cases don’t fall within Texas’ narrow medical exceptions. Last year, he sent
                        a letter threatening to prosecute a doctor who had received court approval to provide an
                        emergency abortion for a Dallas woman. He insisted that the doctor and her patient had not
                        proven how, precisely, the patient’s condition threatened her life.

                    <p>
                        Many doctors say this kind of message has encouraged doctors to “punt” patients instead of
                        treating them. Since the abortion bans went into effect, an OB-GYN at a major hospital in San
                        Antonio has seen an uptick in pregnant patients being sent to them from across Southern Texas,
                        as they suffer from complications that could easily be treated close to home. The well-resourced
                        hospital is perceived to have more institutional support to provide abortions and miscarriage
                        management, the doctor said. Other providers “are transferring those patients to our centers
                        because, frankly, they don’t want to deal with them.” After Crain died, Fails couldn’t stop
                        thinking about how Christus Southeast Hospital had ignored her daughter’s condition. “She was
                        bleeding,” she said. “Why didn’t they do anything to help it along instead of wait for another
                        ultrasound to confirm the baby is dead?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was the medical examiner, not the doctors at the hospital, who removed Lillian from Crain’s
                        womb. His autopsy didn’t resolve Fails’ lingering questions about what the hospitals missed and
                        why. He called the death “natural” and attributed it to “complications of pregnancy.” He did
                        note, however, that Crain was “repeatedly seeking medical care for a progressive illness” just
                        before she died.

                        A Third Woman Died Under Texas’ Abortion Ban. Doctors Are Avoiding D&Cs and Reaching for Riskier
                        Miscarriage Treatments. Last November, Fails reached out to medical malpractice lawyers to see
                        about getting justice through the courts. A different legal barrier now stood in her way. If
                        Crain had experienced these same delays as an inpatient, Fails would have needed to establish
                        that the hospital violated medical standards. That, she believed, she could do. But because the
                        delays and discharges occurred in an area of the hospital classified as an emergency room,
                        lawyers said that Texas law set a much higher burden of proof: “willful and wanton negligence.”
                        No lawyer has agreed to take the case.
